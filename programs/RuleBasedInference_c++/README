The Assigment:  create a virtual machine capable of inferencing logic.

Specifically what we had to do...

1.) allow user to manage two sets of data, facts and rules, which are represented in a
horn clause like format.

2.) allow user to inquire about facts through inferencing rules.

3.) allow user to make an inference a rule of a fact. For instance, using the above KB
and RB

Example...

user input:
fact Mother(Marry,John)
fact Father(Allen,Margret)
fact Mother(Margret,Robert)
fact Mother(Margret,Bob)
rule Parent($X,$Y):- OR Father($X,$Y) Mother($X,$Y)
rule GrandFather($X,$Y):- AND Father($X,$Z) Parent($Z,$Y)
infer Parent($X,$Y)

output:
X Y
Marry,John
Allen,Margret
Margret,Robert
Margret,Bob

input:
infer GrandFather($X,$Y)

output:
X Y
Allen Albert
Allen Bob
